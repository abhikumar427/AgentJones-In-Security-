# In-Security
A Cyber Security Educational Game in Pixi.js


Before you start running the code, create a folder for your project, and launch a webserver in the project's root directory.

If you aren't running a webserver, Pixi won't work.

Next Just run the game.html file in the webserver to work on the game.

Enjoy the game!
